# Jess Hunter's Art Website

## My photography website has 3 pages:
1. Homepage (index.html)
2. Photo Gallery (photos.html)
3. About (about.html)

## I have made my code efficient by using common files for:
1. Header (header.html)
2. Footer (footer.html)

## I imported the Header and Footer using the jQuery .load() function.

## I used an imported library called Bootstrap for:
1. The layout of the Header and the Bootstrap dropdown navigation with the 'collapsed' list item
2. The Footer
3. The layout of the Photo Gallery (a customisable grid)
4. The layout of the About page (a customisable grid)

## I imported and used Google fonts for all my fonts
